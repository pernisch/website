    title: LifeGraph and VideoGraph
    summary: With a team from DDIS (Dynamic and Distributed Information systems, University of Zurich) we participated in two information retrieval challenges, the "Lifelog Search Challenge" and the video retrieval challenge. We used a knowledge graph in the background with a SPARQL interface to query. In the front end we modified the existing system called vitrivr slightly. The keywords were then mapped into triple patterns, also providing suggestions. The knowledge graph construction and systems are detailed <href a=https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/187352/1/DDIS___LSC_2020.pdf>here</href> (LifeGraph) and <href a=https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/204894/1/2021_VBS_VideoGraph.pdf>here</href> (VideoGraph).
